So with this in mind, and just thinking about literature in general, the number of lines, and the length of those lines, are probably indicative to some degree of who is speaking. While this may not be a perfect indicator, a ranking of linespace by actor may give a slight probabilitistic advantage. We would expect central characters to speak more, and have longer lines. Implicitly, longer runs of lines may indicate a significant player. \n",

I will be using OneHotEncoding to try to make this play nicely with KMeans, as there shouldn't be too many extracted features from the lines themselves. From this I think that so long as the play itself sort of creates the hyperplane, the dimensionality shouldn't be too much of an issue.\n",

That isn't to say the Random Forest performed poorly, and perhaps a different seed would perform differently. This may also indicate the need for a different train/test split. \n"
